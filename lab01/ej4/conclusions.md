## Small lists
For lists under 10 elements **quick sort is the winner**. Despite it *does much more comparisons and swaps than other algorithms* **it's the fastest**.  
Insertion sort it's the second more fast, very closely to quick sort, taking similar time to complete it execution but making fewer comparisons and swaps.  
Selection sort does similar comparison than insertion sort, but more swaps than quick sort taking much more time than everyone.

## Medium and large list
For list over 10 elements and even more 1000 there's a tendence of **insertion sort to be the fastest**. It does only the necessary swaps to order the elemetns and a similar number of comparison than selection sort, taking a fewer time to complete it execution than it's competitors.  
Selection sort takes around 20% more time than insertion sort to finish. It looks like it's caused the great number of swaps it does.  
Quick sort it's the worse, it takes twice time than insertion sort doing a number of swaps similar to selection sort and the double for comparison.  

## Conclusion
Quick sort it's the best for very small lists, but insertion sort it's a powerful algorithm with great performance for all kinds of lists.
